These scripts are used to fetch data from the UN SDG, ND-GAIN, and World Bank APIs.

# Current Configurations
## UN SDG
The UN SDG Fetching Client is currently just configured to fetch goals, indicators, and targets from one specific url: 

* `https://unstats.un.org/SDGAPI/v1/sdg/Goal/List`

**Note**: We will be fetching specific indicators to be defined by PlanCatalyst. For now, we're just establishing a basis for the code architecture.
