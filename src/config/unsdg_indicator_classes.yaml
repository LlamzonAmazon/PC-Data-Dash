# UN SDG Indicator Classes

# This file maps indicator class codes to their human-readable names.
# For indicators with multiple classes (e.g., 3.d.1 with 13 IHR capacities),
# each class code maps to a descriptive name.
#
# Two types of class encoding:
# 1. Dimension-based: Uses a dimension field (e.g., "IHR Capacity" for 3.d.1)
# 2. Series-based: Uses series codes to distinguish classes (e.g., 2.1.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3)
#
# Fetch behavior:
# - fetch_by_dimension: Set true ONLY when the API does not populate the distinguishing
#   field in bulk (e.g. 3.d.1 returns many rows but all with same "IHR Capacity"). Then we
#   request once per dimension value so each row gets the correct class. Dimension values
#   are taken from classes keys.
# - Series-based indicators (dimension_field: "series_code") do NOT need fetch_by_dimension:
#   the API already returns one row per series with the correct "series" field in bulk.
#
# The cleaning code uses dimension_field and classes to add class_code and class_name.

indicator_classes:
  # 3.d.1: International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity
  # API returns correct "IHR Capacity" only when requested per dimension.
